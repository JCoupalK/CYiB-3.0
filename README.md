## The source code of the video game *Cover Yourself in Blood* made on the Unity 3D engine, my first Steam released video game

**If you want to play it it's at: <https://store.steampowered.com/app/2725460/Cover_Yourself_in_Blood/>**

This is the 3.0.1 Version, aka the Steam version and is not the same as the 2.1 version on itch.io.

This code will probably not be used but I wanted to make it open anyway for archiving purposes.

If it used though it should be noted this will only work inside the Unity Engine, the game was made on version 2021.3.10f1.
