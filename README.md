## The source code of the video game *Cover Yourself in Blood* made on the Unity 3D engine, my first Steam released video game. 

**If you want to play it it's at: [https://jordancup.itch.io/cover-yourself-in-blood](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2725460/Cover_Yourself_in_Blood/)**

This code will probably not be used but I wanted to make it open anyway for archiving purposes.
