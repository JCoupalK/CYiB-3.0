## The source code of the video game *Cover Yourself in Blood* made on the Unity 3D engine, my first publicly released video game. 

**If you want to play it it's at: https://jordancup.itch.io/cover-yourself-in-blood**

This is the 2.1 Version, aka the itch.io version and is not the same as the 3.0.1 version on Steam.

This code will probably not be used but I wanted to make it open anyway for archiving purposes.
